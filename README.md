# Android Web rotator (in JAVA)

It is shows different pages in WebView in specific interval. I created this app in copy pasta style from example apps [Timer](https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/android/Timer) and [WebViewDemo](https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/android/WebViewDemo).

This  [android-web-rotator](https://github.com/roolo/android-web-rotator) rewritten to JAVA. 
I wanted to try the difference between writing the app in RubyMotion and in JAVA.
